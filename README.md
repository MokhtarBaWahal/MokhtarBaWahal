## üîß Notable Projects  

### **Immersive Digital Twin for Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV)**  
Developed an **immersive digital twin system** for an AGV in collaboration with Siemens Academy. The system enhances situational awareness and human-computer interaction by integrating **virtual reality (VR) capabilities** with a **dockerized private cloud**. It enables **real-time interaction** and **precise control**, improving AGV operational efficiency in complex environments. This project showcases how immersive technologies can revolutionize robotics and was completed as my **senior project**.  

### **AI-Generated Voice Detection**  
Led the development of **deepfake audio detection** algorithms, leveraging **advanced machine learning techniques** to enhance detection accuracy. Using **PyTorch**, I worked on significant architecture updates to improve **model performance**. With the rise of **deepfake audio since 2022**, this project addresses misinformation and fraud risks in **audio-based authentication systems**.  

### **THE ‚Äì A Rust-Based Linux Task Manager**  
THE is a **user-friendly Linux task manager** featuring a sleek UI for essential system monitoring. It includes functionalities like **process monitoring, sorting, killing, and process tree visualization**. Built using **Rust and TUI libraries**, THE provides an intuitive experience for both beginners and experienced users, offering a balance of **simplicity and powerful system control**.
